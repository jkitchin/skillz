## Validation Checklist

Before deploying your skill, verify:

- [ ] `name` field uses only lowercase, numbers, and hyphens
- [ ] `name` is 64 characters or less
- [ ] `description` clearly explains "what" and "when"
- [ ] `description` is 1024 characters or less
- [ ] YAML frontmatter is valid (three dashes at start and end)
- [ ] File is saved as `SKILL.md` in the skill directory
- [ ] Instructions are clear and actionable
- [ ] Dependencies are listed in description
- [ ] Tool restrictions are appropriate for the task
- [ ] Examples demonstrate expected behavior

---

## Testing Your Skill

1. **Install the skill:**
   ```bash
   # For personal use
   mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/your-skill-name
   cp SKILL.md ~/.claude/skills/your-skill-name/

   # For project use
   mkdir -p .claude/skills/your-skill-name
   cp SKILL.md .claude/skills/your-skill-name/
   ```

2. **Test discovery:**
   - Start Claude Code
   - Ask a question that should trigger your skill
   - Claude should automatically use the skill (no explicit invocation needed)

3. **Debug if needed:**
   ```bash
   claude --debug
   ```
   Look for skill loading errors in the output

4. **Iterate:**
   - Refine the description if Claude doesn't invoke it when expected
   - Add more specific trigger conditions
   - Adjust tool restrictions if operations fail

## Example: Complete Skill

Here's a real example of a properly formatted skill:

```markdown
---
name: pdf-text-extractor
description: |
  Extract text and tables from PDF files. Use when the user asks to read,
  analyze, or extract content from PDF documents. Can handle text extraction,
  table parsing, and basic structure analysis.

  Requires: pdfplumber, PyPDF2
allowed-tools: Read, Bash, Write
---

# PDF Text Extractor

## Purpose

This skill extracts text and tables from PDF files for analysis, processing,
or conversion to other formats.

## When to Use

This skill should be invoked when:
- User provides a PDF file path and asks to read or extract its content
- User wants to analyze text within a PDF
- User needs to convert PDF tables to structured data

## Capabilities

1. **Text Extraction**: Extract all text content from PDF pages
2. **Table Parsing**: Identify and extract tables as structured data
3. **Metadata Reading**: Access PDF metadata (title, author, page count)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Verify PDF exists
Use the Bash tool to check if the PDF file exists and is readable.

### Step 2: Extract content
Use Python with pdfplumber to extract text and tables:
```python
import pdfplumber

with pdfplumber.open(pdf_path) as pdf:
    for page in pdf.pages:
        text = page.extract_text()
        tables = page.extract_tables()
```

### Step 3: Format output
Present the extracted content in a clear, structured format.

## Requirements

- Python package: pdfplumber
- Python package: PyPDF2
- Valid PDF file path

## Best Practices

- Always verify file exists before attempting extraction
- Handle multi-page PDFs page by page
- Report extraction errors clearly to the user
- For large PDFs, show progress indicators

## Limitations

- Cannot extract text from image-based PDFs (requires OCR)
- Complex table structures may need manual review
- Password-protected PDFs require password input
```

## Tips for Great Skills

1. **Be Specific**: Vague descriptions lead to skills that are never invoked
2. **One Focus**: Each skill should do one thing well
3. **Clear Triggers**: List explicit conditions that should trigger the skill
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Try multiple phrasings that should invoke your skill
5. **Document Dependencies**: Always list required packages or tools
6. **Restrict Tools**: Use `allowed-tools` for security-sensitive operations
7. **Provide Examples**: Show what good usage looks like
8. **Iterate**: Refine based on how often it's actually invoked

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Too broad**: "Helps with programming" → Should be "Python async/await patterns"
2. **No trigger conditions**: Description doesn't explain when to use it
3. **Missing dependencies**: Skill uses packages but doesn't list them
4. **Wrong tool access**: Needs Bash but `allowed-tools` doesn't include it
5. **Invalid name**: Uses uppercase, spaces, or special characters
6. **Too long**: Description exceeds 1024 characters
7. **Unclear instructions**: Steps are vague or ambiguous
