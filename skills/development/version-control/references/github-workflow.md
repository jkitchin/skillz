### Draft PRs

**Use for work-in-progress:**
```bash
# Push branch
git push -u origin feat/new-feature

# Create as draft PR on GitHub
# Checkbox: "Create as draft"
```

**Benefits:**
- Early feedback on approach
- Show progress to team
- Run CI checks
- Mark ready for review when done

### PR Labels

**Common labels:**
- `bug` - Bug fixes
- `enhancement` - New features
- `documentation` - Docs changes
- `refactoring` - Code restructuring
- `performance` - Performance improvements
- `security` - Security fixes
- `breaking-change` - Breaking changes
- `needs-review` - Ready for review
- `work-in-progress` - Not ready yet
- `blocked` - Waiting on something
- `urgent` - High priority
- `good-first-issue` - For new contributors

### PR Size Guidelines

**Extra Small (XS):** <10 lines
- Typo fixes
- Config changes
- Simple bug fixes

**Small (S):** 10-100 lines
- Single feature addition
- Bug fix with tests
- Small refactoring
- Ideal PR size

**Medium (M):** 100-300 lines
- Feature with multiple components
- Acceptable with good description

**Large (L):** 300-500 lines
- Complex feature
- Should consider splitting
- Requires extra review time

**Extra Large (XL):** 500+ lines
- Too large!
- Split into smaller PRs
- Use feature flags to merge incrementally

## Code Review on GitHub

### As a Reviewer

**1. Review the code:**
- Read PR description first
- Understand the goal
- Check out branch locally to test
- Review files on GitHub

**2. Leave comments:**

**General comment:**
```
Overall looks good! Just a few minor suggestions.
```

**Inline comment:**
```
Consider extracting this into a separate function for
better testability.
```

**Suggestion (GitHub will let author apply directly):**
```suggestion
const result = await fetchUser(userId);
```

**3. Request changes or approve:**
- **Approve:** Code is good to merge
- **Request changes:** Issues must be fixed
- **Comment:** Feedback without blocking

### Review Best Practices

**Do:**
- ✅ Review within 2-4 hours (small PRs)
- ✅ Test code locally
- ✅ Be constructive and specific
- ✅ Explain the "why" behind suggestions
- ✅ Praise good code
- ✅ Distinguish blocking vs non-blocking feedback

**Don't:**
- ❌ Nitpick code style (use linter instead)
- ❌ Leave PRs waiting for days
- ❌ Just say "looks good" without reviewing
- ❌ Be vague ("this doesn't look right")
- ❌ Rewrite in your own style

**Comment prefixes:**
```
nit: Minor style suggestion (non-blocking)
suggestion: Consider this approach
question: Can you explain this?
blocker: Must be fixed before merge
optional: Nice to have
```

### Responding to Review Feedback

**As author:**

**1. Respond to each comment:**
```
Good catch! Fixed in abc123.

or

I kept it this way because... but open to other approaches.

or

Not sure I understand - can you clarify?
```

**2. Make requested changes:**
```bash
# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "fix(auth): address PR feedback"
git push origin feat/new-feature
```

**3. Mark conversations as resolved:**
- Click "Resolve conversation" after addressing
- Let reviewer resolve their own comments

**4. Re-request review:**
- Click "Re-request review" icon after pushing changes
- Add comment: "Ready for another look!"

### Review Checklist

## Branch Protection Rules

### Essential Rules

Configure for `main` branch:

**1. Require pull request before merging:**
- ✅ Enable
- Required approvals: 1 (or 2 for larger teams)
- ✅ Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed
- ✅ Require review from Code Owners

**2. Require status checks to pass:**
- ✅ Enable
- ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
- Required checks:
  - Tests
  - Lint
  - Build
  - Coverage

**3. Require conversation resolution:**
- ✅ Require all conversations to be resolved before merging

**4. Require linear history:**
- ✅ Enable (enforces rebase or squash merge)

**5. Additional settings:**
- ✅ Do not allow bypassing the above settings
- ✅ Restrict who can push to matching branches (admins only)
- ✅ Allow force pushes: Disable
- ✅ Allow deletions: Disable
- ✅ Automatically delete head branches: Enable

### CODEOWNERS File

Create `.github/CODEOWNERS`:

```
# Default owners for everything
* @org/core-team

# Frontend code
/src/components/** @org/frontend-team @user1
/src/styles/** @org/frontend-team

# Backend code
/src/api/** @org/backend-team @user2
/src/database/** @org/backend-team @user3

# DevOps
/.github/workflows/** @org/devops-team
/Dockerfile @org/devops-team
/docker-compose.yml @org/devops-team

# Documentation
/docs/** @user4
README.md @user4

# Critical files require additional review
/package.json @org/senior-devs
/tsconfig.json @org/senior-devs
/.github/workflows/deploy.yml @org/devops-lead
```

**Effects:**
- Auto-assigns reviewers based on files changed
- Can require CODEOWNERS approval in branch protection

## Collaboration Best Practices

### PR Etiquette

**As author:**
- Write clear PR descriptions
- Keep PRs small and focused
- Respond to feedback promptly
- Don't merge your own PRs without review
- Thank reviewers

**As reviewer:**
- Review promptly (within 2-4 hours)
- Be constructive and specific
- Explain reasoning for changes
- Approve when ready, don't hold up
- Use appropriate tone

### Communication

**In PR comments:**
```markdown
Great work! Just a few suggestions:

1. Consider extracting the validation logic into a separate
   function. This would make it easier to test and reuse.

2. The error handling looks good, but we should also log
   errors to our monitoring service.

Otherwise this looks ready to go! 🚀
```

**In issue comments:**
```markdown
I've investigated this issue and found that...

To reproduce:
1. ...
2. ...

Proposed fix: ...

I can take this on if no one else is working on it.
```

### Mention Protocol

**@mentions:**
- `@username` - Notify specific person
- `@org/team` - Notify team
- Use sparingly - don't spam

**When to mention:**
- Need specific person's input
- Question for code owner
- Blocked on something
- FYI for stakeholder

**When not to mention:**
- Already auto-assigned as reviewer
- General question (ask in discussion instead)
- Just to get attention faster

## Advanced GitHub Features
