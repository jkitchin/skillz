# Image Generation Skill

AI-powered image generation and editing using Google Gemini and OpenAI DALL-E models.

## Overview

This skill enables Claude Code to generate and edit images using state-of-the-art AI models from Google (Gemini) and OpenAI (DALL-E). Create photorealistic images, illustrations, logos, product mockups, and artistic compositions from natural language descriptions. Edit existing images with text instructions, apply style transfers, and refine outputs through iterative conversation.

**Attribution:** This skill is inspired by the `gemini-imagegen` skill from [Every Marketplace](https://github.com/EveryInc/every-marketplace/tree/main/plugins/compounding-engineering/skills/gemini-imagegen) by Every Inc. We're grateful for their pioneering work in AI image generation skills.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install the skill from the skillz repository
skillz install image-generation

# Or copy to your project
cp -r skills/creative/image-generation .claude/skills/
```

### Requirements

**API Keys:**
```bash
# Set environment variables
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-api-key"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
```

**Python Dependencies:**
```bash
pip install google-generativeai openai pillow requests
```

### Basic Usage

Once installed, simply ask Claude to generate or edit images:

```
"Generate a professional headshot for LinkedIn"
"Create a logo for a coffee shop called Mountain Peak Coffee"
"Change the background of this photo to a beach sunset"
"Make this landscape look like it was painted by Van Gogh"
```

Claude will automatically:
1. Recognize the image generation request
2. Select the appropriate model
3. Craft an effective prompt
4. Generate the image
5. Save it and show you the result

## Model Selection Guide

**Choose Gemini Flash when:**
- Need rapid iteration
- Working on concepts/drafts
- Speed is priority
- Budget-conscious

**Choose Gemini Pro when:**
- Creating final deliverables
- Need 2K-4K resolution
- Complex compositions
- Text must be legible in image

**Choose DALL-E 3 when:**
- Want highest quality
- Creative interpretation preferred
- Artistic/illustrative content
- Natural language prompts

**Choose DALL-E 2 when:**
- Need multiple variations
- Editing existing images
- Budget is constrained
- Quick prototyping

## Tips for Best Results

### 1. Be Specific
Detailed prompts produce better, more consistent results.

**Vague:** "A nice landscape"
**Specific:** "Mountain valley at sunrise, mist over lake, pine trees, warm golden light, peaceful"

### 2. Include Style Information
Always specify the artistic style or photographic approach.

Examples: `photorealistic`, `digital illustration`, `oil painting`, `3D render`, `vintage photography`

### 3. Describe Lighting
Lighting dramatically affects mood and quality.

Examples: `golden hour lighting`, `studio lighting`, `dramatic side lighting`, `soft diffused light`

### 4. Specify Composition
Guide how elements should be arranged.

Examples: `centered composition`, `rule of thirds`, `close-up`, `wide angle`, `overhead view`

### 5. Iterate Thoughtfully
Use conversation to refine results progressively rather than starting over.

## Troubleshooting

### Image Quality Issues
- Use Gemini Pro or DALL-E 3 for higher quality
- Add technical details: "high resolution", "professional quality", "sharp focus"
- Be more specific about lighting and style

### Unexpected Results
- Make prompts more explicit and detailed
- Specify what you don't want (via positive alternatives)
- Try a different model

### Text in Images
- Use Gemini Pro (best for text rendering)
- Specify exact text in quotes
- Keep text simple and prominent

### API Errors
- Verify API keys are set correctly
- Check rate limits and quotas
- Review content policy compliance
- Implement retry logic with backoff

## Cost Optimization

1. **Prototype with cheaper models** (Gemini Flash, DALL-E 2)
2. **Generate finals with premium models** (Gemini Pro, DALL-E 3)
3. **Use appropriate resolutions** (don't use 4K when 1K suffices)
4. **Batch similar requests** together
5. **Save successful prompts** for reuse

## Content Policies

Both Google and OpenAI have content policies that prohibit:
- Violence, gore, or disturbing content
- Hate symbols or discriminatory content
- Sexual or adult content
- Illegal activities
- Real identifiable people without consent
- Copyrighted characters or IP

Keep prompts appropriate and focused on original creative content.
