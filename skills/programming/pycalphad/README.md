# pycalphad Skill

This skill provides expert guidance for using **pycalphad**, a Python library for computational thermodynamics based on the CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse Diagrams) method.

## What is pycalphad?

pycalphad is an open-source Python library that enables researchers to:
- Calculate phase diagrams for multicomponent materials systems
- Determine phase equilibria at specified thermodynamic conditions
- Compute thermodynamic properties from CALPHAD databases
- Model ordered phases, charged species, and complex phase transformations
- Automate thermodynamic calculations for materials design

## When to Use This Skill

This skill is automatically invoked when you:
- Ask about calculating phase diagrams
- Need to perform equilibrium thermodynamic calculations
- Want to compute activities, chemical potentials, or other thermodynamic properties
